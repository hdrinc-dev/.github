# .github Repository

This repository contains **organization-wide defaults and templates** for GitHub.  
Anything stored here is automatically applied or made available to all repositories in this org, unless overridden locally.

## 📂 What’s Inside

### ✅ Pull Request Template
- A default **Pull Request template** is provided in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.  
- This ensures all contributors follow the same structure when opening PRs, making reviews easier and more consistent.

### ⚙️ Workflow Templates
- Workflow templates are stored in `.github/workflow-templates/`.  
- These are suggested in the **“New workflow”** screen when setting up GitHub Actions in any repository in this org.  
- They help standardize common CI/CD workflows across projects.

---

## 🛠 How It Works
- Files in this repo are **organization-wide defaults**.
- Individual repositories can **override** these defaults by placing their own versions of the same files locally (e.g., their own `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).
